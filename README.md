# 🎈 Rainbow Breeze – Interactive Balloon Animation

A fun and colorful mini web project where **seven rainbow-colored balloons sway gently in the wind**, hanging from a wooden log and responding to user interaction.

Each balloon:
- 🌬 Sways realistically as if floating in a calm breeze  
- 🧵 Hangs from a rope with a knot for added realism  
- 🎨 Changes the background to match its color when clicked  
- 💡 Designed for lantern-style glow effects in night mode  
- 🔁 Can be reset using a switch button

> Created purely **for fun, creativity, and animation practice** using *only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.*
